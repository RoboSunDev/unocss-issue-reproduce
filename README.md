this is a plain very basic uni-app project, just like how you create a vue app by run cli command, 
besides that, the only thing is just by doing npm install unocss@version and try to import the unocss



check the unocss version and change it to 66.1.0-beta.11 or any greater than 66.1.0-beta.10; then do:
```bash
npm install
```

then run

```bash
npm run dev:mp-weixin
```

check the files in foler dist, 

for version 66.1.0-beta.10; everything is fine; the app.wxss and pages/index/index.wxss both ok

but for 66.1.0-beta.11; the wired thing happened

**so i highly doubt about the enhancement between the version 66.1.0-beta.10 and 66.1.0-beta.11**

it doesn't seems to be related with uni-app, but with unocss

could u please help me to find out why and is there anyway we can fix this? or do i or anyone have the same issue with me, have the honor to have your perfect guys to fix this or a solution?
Appreciated! very much!
